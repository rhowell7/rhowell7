I'm __Rose Howell__, a Software Developer passionate about Python, Machine Learning, and Backend development.

### 👩‍💻 A Bit More About Me

I hold a Master's in Computer Science from the University of Michigan, and a Bachelor's in Information Assurance from Eastern Michigan University. I'm a big fan of continuous learning, clean code, and solving real-world problems with technology.

When I'm not coding, I'm likely improving things at home 🛠️, spending time with my pets 🐶🐱🐔, or working in my garden 🌶️. I also enjoy reading, cooking, and getting involved in projects that make a difference.
